#As a user, I would like to:

- know what is their most popular / on sale items (?)
- add items to cart
- view cart for all ordered items
- increase / decrease my orders in the cart (?)
- see total price on page at all times (?)
- place order, and get a response for successful orders
- get an estimated time (?)
- get notified by SMS when order is ready


#As a resturant owner, I would like to:
- be notified as a customer make an order
- add the order to a database with order_status to 'open'
- provide a time estimate based on time of day and number of orders (?)
- notify customer by SMS when order is ready
- close the order by updating the order_status to 'completed'
- change order status for unexpected events e.g. 'cancelled' (?)
